  caveats <<~EOS
    This package requires admin privileges to install.
    The package installs an app-like bundle with an embedded Endpoint Security
    provisioning profile and exposes /usr/local/bin/edamame_posture as a
    symlink into that bundle.

    To run it as a service that survives reboots (EDAMAME >= 2.0.2):
      sudo edamame_posture install-service
    then edit /Library/Application Support/EDAMAME/EDAMAME-Posture/edamame_posture.conf
    and restart it with:
      sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.edamametechnologies.edamame-posture
  EOS
end
